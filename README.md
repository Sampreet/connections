# Connections

> Your personal connection analyzer.

## Overview of the Application

***Connections*** checks your connected network in regular intervals and stores the network connection statistics locally. It also features APIs to visualize the collected information.

### C Monitor

The **C Monitor** API monitors the network to which the computer is connected and estimates the bandwidth used by it.

## Development
